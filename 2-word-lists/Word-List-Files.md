## Word List Files

A total of 27 different word list files are available. Word list files which are made available via symbolic links are excluded. Note that each word list file has a unique name. Normally, these are installed in `/usr/share/dict/`. Note that medical word lists such as `wgerman-medical` and non-standard length word lists such as `wamerican-huge`, `wamerican-insane`, `wamerican-large`, `wamerican-small`, `wbritish-huge`, `wbritish-insane`, `wbritish-large`, `wbritish-small`, `wcanadian-huge`, `wcanadian-insane`, `wcanadian-large`, `wcanadian-small` and `scowl` are omitted. Please, note that for many of the files not yet in Unicode format, bug reports have already been filed and most of those have already been fixed in upcoming releases of the packages by which these files get shipped.
